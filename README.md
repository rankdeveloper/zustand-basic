## Zustand

- It is a state management library for React.
- It allows you to manage global and local scope efficiently , using a simple API that avoids the complexity of other tools like Redux.
- Zustand stands out because it doesn't rely on React context provider under the hood , so it avoids the performance issues that come with unnecessary re-renders.
